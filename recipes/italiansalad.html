    <li>Get ready. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.</li>
    <li>Make the dressing. In a small bowl, whisk together ¼ cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, a pinch of salt and pepper, and ½ to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (depending on how spicy you like things). Set aside.</li>
    <li>Cook the pasta. Generously salt the boiling water, then add the pasta and cook until al dente according to the package instructions. Drain and add to a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Toss the pasta salad. To the bowl with the pasta, add 1 pint halved tomatoes, 1 chopped bell pepper, 1 chopped shallot, 1 cup artichoke hearts, ¼ cup pitted Kalamata olives, 6 chopped pepperoncini, 6-8 ounces sliced salami, 6 ounces mozzarella, and ½ packed cup each of chopped parsley and basil. Toss to combine. </li>
    <li>Dress the salad. Pour the dressing over the pasta and toss to coat. Serve immediately, or better yet let it sit for 30 minutes to soak up all the flavor. </li>
